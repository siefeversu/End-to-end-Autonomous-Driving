In this section, we will provide some tips and tricks on how to operate your Mitsubishi Tractor MT 205 effectively and safely. Please note that these are general guidelines and may not apply to every situation. Always refer to your owner's manual and service manual for specific instructions and warnings.
 
## How to Start and Stop the Engine
 
To start the engine, make sure that the parking brake is engaged, the gear shift lever is in neutral, the PTO lever is disengaged, and the throttle lever is in the low position. Turn the key switch to the ON position and wait for the glow plug indicator to go off. Then, turn the key switch to the START position and release it as soon as the engine starts. Do not crank the engine for more than 10 seconds at a time. If the engine does not start, wait for 10 seconds before trying again.
 
To stop the engine, reduce the engine speed by moving the throttle lever to the low position. Turn off any electrical devices and attachments. Turn the key switch to the OFF position and remove the key. Wait for the engine to cool down before performing any maintenance or inspection.
 
## How to Change Gears
 
The MT 205 has 6 forward gears and 2 reverse gears. To change gears, press the clutch pedal fully and move the gear shift lever to the desired position. Release the clutch pedal gradually and smoothly. Do not change gears while the tractor is moving at high speed or under heavy load. Do not force the gear shift lever into position or move it rapidly. This may damage the transmission or cause accidents.
 
## How to Use the PTO
 
The PTO (power take-off) is a device that transfers power from the engine to an attachment, such as a mower or a tiller. The MT 205 has a rear PTO with a speed of 540 rpm. To use the PTO, make sure that the attachment is properly connected and secured. Start the engine and let it warm up. Move the PTO lever to the engaged position and adjust the throttle lever to obtain the desired PTO speed. To disengage the PTO, move the PTO lever to the disengaged position and reduce the engine speed.
 
## How to Use the Hydraulic System
 
The hydraulic system is used to operate attachments that require hydraulic power, such as a front loader or a backhoe. The MT 205 has a three-point hitch system that can lift up to 500 kg of weight. To use the hydraulic system, make sure that the attachment is properly connected and secured. Start the engine and let it warm up. Move the hydraulic control lever to raise or lower the attachment as needed. Do not overload or overwork the hydraulic system. Check the hydraulic fluid level regularly and refill it if necessary.
