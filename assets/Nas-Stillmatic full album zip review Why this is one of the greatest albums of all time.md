Nas responded with Stillmatic, an album that proved his critics wrong and reignited his passion for hip-hop. He addressed his feud with Jay-Z on the scathing track "Ether", which is widely regarded as one of the best diss songs ever. He also reflected on his life, his struggles, and his hopes on tracks like "You're Da Man", "Rewind", and "My Country". He also collaborated with some of the best producers and guest artists in the industry, such as DJ Premier, Large Professor, AZ, Mary J. Blige, and Amerie.
  
Another reason why Nas-Stillmatic full album zip is so special is the impact it had on the hip-hop culture and the music industry. The album revived Nas' reputation as one of the greatest rappers of all time and inspired a new generation of artists. It also sparked a renewed interest in the East Coast hip-hop scene, which had been overshadowed by the West Coast and the South in the late 1990s. It also influenced the sound and style of many hip-hop albums that followed, such as The Blueprint 2 by Jay-Z, The Eminem Show by Eminem, and Get Rich or Die Tryin' by 50 Cent.
