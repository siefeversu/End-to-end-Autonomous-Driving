Remote Desktop Services (RDS) is a feature of Windows Server 2019 that allows users to access applications and desktops from any device and location. However, RDS in Windows Server 2019 has some limitations and does not support all the features that are available in Windows 10. For example, Windows Server Desktop Experience and Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) do not include newer features such as Microsoft Cortana, which is a voice-activated digital assistant, the Microsoft Store, which is an online marketplace for apps and games, and the Xbox app and services, which are related to gaming and entertainment. Moreover, RDSH 2019 will not support Office 365 Pro Plus, which is a subscription-based version of Office that includes cloud services and updates, and instead will only use Office 2019 perpetual, which is a one-time purchase version of Office that does not receive any updates or cloud services.
  
Despite these limitations, RDS in Windows Server 2019 still offers some benefits and improvements over previous versions. For instance, RDS 2019 supports Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), which is a security service that helps detect and respond to advanced cyberattacks. RDS 2019 also supports HTML5-based web clients, which enable users to access remote desktops and applications from any modern browser without installing any plugins or extensions. Furthermore, RDS 2019 supports Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD), which is a cloud-based service that delivers virtual desktops and applications from Azure.

However, RDS in Windows Server 2019 also has some requirements and considerations that need to be taken into account before deploying it. For example, RDS 2019 requires a minimum of 16 GB of RAM and 32 GB of disk space for each server role. RDS 2019 also requires a valid license for each user or device that accesses the remote desktops and applications. Additionally, RDS 2019 requires a compatible network infrastructure that can handle the bandwidth and latency demands of the remote sessions.
