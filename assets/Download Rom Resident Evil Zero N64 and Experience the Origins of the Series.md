## What is Resident Evil Zero?
 
Resident Evil Zero is a survival horror game that serves as a prequel to the first Resident Evil. It follows the story of Rebecca Chambers, a rookie member of the S.T.A.R.S. Bravo team, and Billy Coen, a former marine convicted of murder. The game takes place in July 1998, one day before the events of Resident Evil, and explores the origins of the T-virus outbreak in Raccoon City.
  
## Why was Resident Evil Zero cancelled for the Nintendo 64?
 
Resident Evil Zero was originally developed for the Nintendo 64 by Capcom and Flagship. The game was announced in 1999 and was scheduled to be released in 2000. However, due to technical limitations of the cartridge format and the impending launch of the GameCube, Capcom decided to cancel the project and move it to the new console. The Nintendo 64 version was never completed or released to the public.
