However, to use VMware Workstation, you need to activate it with a valid serial key. In this article, we will show you how to get a serial key for VMware Workstation 12.5.5 and how to use it to activate the software.
 
## How to Get a Serial Key for VMware Workstation 12.5.5
 
There are two ways to get a serial key for VMware Workstation 12.5.5: either buy it from the official website or use a keygen tool.
